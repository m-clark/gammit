\title{Random effects for gam}
\usage{
extract_ranef(model, re = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{The mgcv model}

\item{re}{Which specific coefficients to extract. Currently not
implemented.}
}
\value{
A \code{tibble} (if possible) or data frame with the random effect, its
standard errror, and its lower and upper bounds. The bounds are based on a
simple normal approximation using the standard error.
}
\description{
Extract what would be the random effects from a mixed model from
a gam object.  Assumes an mgcv model of the form \code{gam(... + s(g, bs='re'))}.
}
\details{
Returns a data frame of the the \code{component} type, the estimated random effect \code{re}, and approximate \code{lower} and \code{upper} bounds assuming  \code{+- 1.96*se}.  Note that the standard errors are Bayesian estimates (see \code{\link{vcov.gam}}, specifically type \code{Vp}).
